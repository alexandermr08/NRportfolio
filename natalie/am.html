	<p>I am a marketing professional born and raised in Houston, TX. I love a good adventure. After 
	graduating from the	University of Texas at Austin, I moved to Portland, Oregon. I fell in love with 
	the beautiful scenery and the food!	However, the call of home was too strong and I missed the Texas 
	heat. I returned to the lone star state, but Portland will always hold a special place in my heart.
	<br><br> I am a fun-loving, people person and I bring that attitude to the work place. My ability to
	form meaningful relationships makes me an effective manager and team leader. Growing up in Houston 
	and living in Austin has taught me to appreciate the variety of life and I look forward to returning
	to a city full of so many different	individuals! <br><br>Some of my loves include: My dogs, a great cup 
	of coffee, a home cooked meal, craft brews,	and being outdoors(preferably with my dogs!)...<br><br>Some
	hobbies of mine: Snowboarding, Cooking, Theatre, and Softball.
